        <p>As a back-end enthusiast, I decided to study cache mechanisms in more depth. During my studies, 
          I came across a type of server called <b>cache server</b>, which is a proxy server that stores data. 
          Some of its main goals are: reduce the workload on the main server, speed up response times
          for users, and decrease bandwidth usage.</p>

        <p>To better understand how it works, I decided to simulate a simple cache server using sockets. 
          While there are several online tutorials that helped me get started, most of them were written 
          in Python, but I wanted to implement my solution in pure Java.</p>

        <p><marked>My approach:</marked></p>

        <ul>
          <li>create a client that communicates with the cache server</li>
          <li>create a cache server that receives and responds to client requests while storing data retrieved from the main server</li>
          <li>use DummyJSON as the main server</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The client sends a request specifying a desired path, such as <code>"/users"</code>. The cache server accepts 
          the socket connection, retrieves the requested path, and searches for a file named <code>"users"</code>. If the 
          file is found locally, its contents are returned to the client. Otherwise, the cache server fetches 
          the data from the main server, stores it locally, and then returns the response to the client.
        </p>

        <p>At first, the implementation seemed very simple, but soon I found myself losing focus on what 
          I actually needed to accomplish. I also realized that I needed to revisit some Java concepts, such as 
          working with sockets, files and making native HTTP requests.
        </p>
        
        <p>Since I find it more convenient to visualize concepts through drawings, I created some sketches
          to better understand the flow.
        </p>

        <div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-direction:column;align-items:center;">
          <img width="300px" src="../assets/articles/cache_server/first_sketch.png"/>
          <p>The first diagram illustrates the main process.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;flex-direction:column;align-items:center;">
          <p>However, when I started writing methods and handling responses, the cache server 
            became too complex for me. To see things even better, I created a second
            diagram.</p>
          <img width="300px" src="../assets/articles/cache_server/second_sketch.png"/>
        </div>

        <p><marked>More work can be done:</marked></p>
        <ul>
          <li>better exception and error handling</li>
          <li>better communication between server and client</li>
          <li>threads to support multiple connections</li>
          <li>separate projects for client and server</li>
          <li>remake the project using nginx</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In the end, this was a fun project. I was able to simulate a cache server to 
          understand better how it works, improve my Java skills, and revisit important 
          programming concepts.</p>
